# WeatherNow
WeatherNow is an interactive website with clean UI where user can get the current weather conditions by typing the location which user wants. I used HTML,CSS and JavaScript to build the website and used Open Meteo API which gives the current status of the weather, Open Meteo API works based on latitude and longitude so i used geocoding API to get the latitude and longitude of the location.
Basically when we run this code we will land on a page which asks for input(cityname) from the user when we enter the input and click on the button it runs asynchronous function in JavaScript which will give cityname to geocoding API and it gives latitude and longitude which i gave it to Open Meteo API to get the current weather details so in the result i displayed the cityname,temperature,time,windspeed,weather condition,winddirection.

enter cityname and search
