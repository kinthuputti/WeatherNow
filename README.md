# WeatherNow
This is a website where we can check the current weather conditions based on the location/city name. So in this project i used HTML ,CSS and JavaScript and also i integrated Open-Meteo API to fetch the weather based on latitude and longitude. and to get the latitude and longitude of the location i used geocoding API.
